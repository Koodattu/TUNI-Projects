\chapter{Future Work and Ideas}
The Voice-Guided Imaging application demonstrates the potential of locally hosted AI pipelines, but there are several ways to extend and improve its functionality. This section outlines key areas for future development.

\subsubsection{Performance and Optimization}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Optimize models with further quantization (e.g., LoRA) to lower memory requirements.
    \item Improve support for multiple users by adding session handling and distributed processing.
    \item Evaluate hybrid architectures—using local hosting for privacy and cloud APIs for heavy workloads.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Benchmarking and Testing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Compare latency, accuracy, and costs between self-hosted models and cloud APIs.
    \item Test scalability under higher workloads to refine performance and stability.
\end{itemize}
